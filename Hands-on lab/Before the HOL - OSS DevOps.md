## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 Minutes

### Task 1: Create a virtual machine to execute the lab

1.  Launch a browser and navigate to <https://portal.azure.com>. Once prompted, login with your Microsoft Azure credentials. If prompted, choose whether your account is an organization account or just a Microsoft Account.

2.  Click on **+Create a resource**, and in the search box type in **Visual Studio Community 2017 on Windows Server 2016 (x64)** and press enter. Click the Visual Studio Community 2017 image running on Windows Server 2016 and with the latest update.

3.  In the returned search results, click the image name.

4.  Click **Create**.

5.  Set the following configuration on the Basics tab and click **OK**:

    -   Subscription: **If you have multiple subscriptions, choose the subscription to execute your labs in.**

    -   Resource Group: **OPSLABRG**

    -   Virtual machine name: **LABVM**
   
    -   Region: **Choose the closest Azure region to you.**

    -   VM disk type: **SSD**

    -   Size: **DS1\_V2 Standard**

        >**Note**: You may have to click the View All link to see the instance sizes.
    
    -   Username: **demouser**

    -   Password: **demo\@pass123**

    -   Select the **Allow selected ports** radio button and check **RDP (3389)**.

6.  Accept the  default values on the remaining blades and click **Review + create**. On the Review + create page click **Create**. The deployment should begin provisioning. It may take 10+ minutes for the virtual machine to complete provisioning.

    >**Note**: Please wait for the LABVM to be provisioned prior to moving to the next step.

7. Move back to the Portal page on your local machine and wait for **LABVM** to show the Status of **Running**. Click **Connect** to establish a new Remote Desktop Session.

8. Depending on your remote desktop protocol client and browser configuration you will either be prompted to open an RDP file, or you will need to download it and then open it separately to connect.

9. Log in with the credentials specified during creation:

    a.  User: **demouser**

    b.  Password: **demo\@pass123**

16. You will be presented with a Remote Desktop Connection warning because of a certificate trust issue. Click **Yes** to continue with the connection.

17. When logging on for the first time you will see a prompt on the right asking about network discovery. Click **No**.

18. After a few moments, notice that Server Manager opens by default. Close this window.

19. On the right side of the pane, click **Off** next to **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.

20. Change to **Off** for Users and click **OK**.

### Task 2: Install Chrome

2.  Click the **Download Chrome** button.

3.  Press **Accept and Install** when prompted.

4.  Press **Run** when prompted to download and begin the installation.

2.  Follow the directions of the installer to complete the installation of MySQL Workbench.

3.  After the installation is complete, **reboot** the machine.
